A resuscitator is used to bring a dead character back to life. It can be activated after combat if the dead character belongs to a party. It will not revive a character playing solo. The resuscitator disappears after being used three times.
A scroll contains a single magic spell with multiple charges. When all charges are used, the scroll disappears. The cost of the scroll reflects the level of the spell and how powerful it is.

This bottle contains a liquid that may remove such debilitating states as poison, paralysis and petrifaction.  There is no guarantee that the cure will work. The more expensive potions have a better chance of working and have more doses.  The bottle will be discarded when empty.
