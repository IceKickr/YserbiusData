This is your character's guild.
Barbarians are known for their great strength, health, and combat abilities.  They are superstitious and shun the mystical, which limits their ability to cast spells and to use some magic items.  However, in a contest of arms they are the betting favorites.  They are front-line fighters.
Knights are well-rounded fighters with some abilities appropriate to their chivalrous mien.  In general knights have the best armor and weapons, but their spell casting ability is weak.  They, too, are front-line fighters.
Rangers are renowned for their archery and for their scouting talents.  They excel at guerilla tactics and can generally cast more magic than the other 'fighting' guilds.  Their tracking skills can be invaluable.  Rangers are better in second rank, where their bows can decimate the enemy, but in a party with thieves and wizards they can stand up to the punishment doled out to front-rank fighters.
Thieves are the skulkers, the spies, the things that go bump into knights.  Their skills at picking locks and pockets make them invaluable members of a party, even if they would be well advised to duck back into second rank.  Their furtiveness skills and good assortment of spells makes them valuable in combat even from second rank.
Clerics are well-beloved spell casters, generally using their spells and skills to cure the sick and weak.  They can use a good assortment of armor and some weapons, but in general clerics use spells to accomplish their goals.  They alone can draw upon divine intervention in the dissipate spell, which is the bane of all undead.
Wizards are the masters of magic in all its forms.  Wizards are weak, spindly, and, compared to the other guilds, easily killed.  But if a wizard can retreat in combat behind a sturdy barbarian or knight, then the wizard can frequently keep the entire party alive, destroying the enemy with a large assortment of spells.
Mana represents the amount of magical energy you have at your disposal.  The more mana you have the more spells you can cast. Your mana increases automatically when you gain an experience level.
