== Movement Functions ==
Fn Name_____            Notes____
ExitDungeon             Leaves dungeon from upper entrance.
GetFacing               Get byte facing (S = 1, E = 2, N = 3, W = 0?)
GetNextTile             Get byte next tile, based on facing:  (Y << 4) | (X)
SetMove28               Sets parameters for next move action:
                            Only seen in 13-code.
                            Always follows SetMove2C, same params.
                            Ignore?
SetMove2C               Sets parameters for next move action:
                            Param0=0 if will fail, 1 if will succeed.
                            Param1=Direction (S = 1, E = 2, N = 3, W = 0?)
                            Param2=Encoded byte tile to move to.
SetMove34               Sets ability to move into this tile from any facing:

SetMove38               Sets floor tile:
                            Param0: FloorType;
                                    0 = stone
                                    1 = pit
                                    2 = lava
                                    3 = water
                            Param1: NextTile
SetMoveMap              Sets paramter for next move action; moving to map:

                            Param3=MapLevel.

SetUnblocked            Sets whether a move is possible.
TileIsNoJoinArea        For whatever reason, no one can join after this event
                        is fired, until the party moves again.

== Interaction Functions ==
Fn Name_____            Notes____
AddEncounter            Adds param1 count of param0 monsters, at RETURN, combat starts
AddTreasure             Adds items to loot screen which will follow combat;
                        Param0 is short gold, params1-5 are loot items with id==paramX.
CheckState              Returns state of type, offset. Always followed by compare. Must not set result flags?
CheckState2             Returns state of type, offset. Seems to automatically set result flags.
CheckState3             Returns state of type, offset. Seems to automatically set result flags.
SetState                Sets state of type param0, index param1, value param2
SetTileFloor            Sets the floor tile to type param0
ShowRunes               Shows message param0 (short) in runes. If rune reading has been used, reveals the message
ShowMessage             Shows message param0 (short).

UnknownFunction1C       Used to afflict status of type == param0 on character
UnknownFunctionC4       Unknown. Only used before the river of eternity taps your life energy (30-code for example).
UnknownFunctionEC       Unknown. Always passed with short param 0x000f and compared to another param (value from 2-15).
                        Always used in context of an NPC giving advice or ignoring/attacking you.
                        I doubt it has anything to do with checking a level.
UsedItem                Returns 1 if player has used this item on this tile/facing.
                        Any item between id == param0 and id == param1 are allowed.
UsedSkill               If player has used character.skill(param0), returns skill level, else 0.
