From http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/XMI_Format:
The file format is made up of two standard Interchange File Format (IFF) files
one after the other. As there is more than one root-level chunk in the same
file, technically the file does not meet the IFF standard which only allows one
root-level chunk per file. The chunks are arranged as follows:

FORM (type XDIR)
    INFO

Immediately following this is another IFF file, which contains a FORM subchunk
for each sequence (song) stored in the XMI file:

CAT (type XMID)
FORM (type XMID) - first song
TIMB
EVNT
FORM (type XMID) - second song (optional)
TIMB
EVNT
etc. for as many songs as needed

For AD00.XMI:

4b  ChunkLength 0000000E == 14

    4b  ChunkType   XDIR
    4b  ChunkName   INFO            // Number of songs in this XMI file
