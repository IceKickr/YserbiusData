If I was to use the existing Yserbius resource files to bootstrap a new Cano

CanoMapScripts:
Header:
  uint magic
  uint ScriptCode byte length
  uint function offset x 256.
ScriptCode:
  Byte[] data, opcodes + parameters.
  The CanoScriptVM interprets opcodes.
  Each opcode represents a single command.
  Yserbius has 46 commands. ScriptCode will need 16 more for math, program flow, and register swapping.
  Each Opcode has zero or one or more following parameters. The number of parameters is constant for each command type.
  Parameters are encoded by a leading byte Type.
