This is the map file - contains information about the physical state of the map.
Also contains 'tags' that indicate what is present in each tile. The file is
scrambled - to unscramble, the game reads the data as 16 bit words and shifts
each word 2 bits to the left, rolling the 2 hi bits over to the right.

Each map is made up of a structure of 6416 bytes. Not all data is read to create
the map. The first 16 bytes are some kind of header, but only the first 3 bytes
are ever set. Examples of first four maps:

Dungeon Ent.    01  01  01  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00
The Mines       01  04  04  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00
Vestibule       01  05  05  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00
Hall of Doors   01  05  05  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00

I believe these three bytes are indexes of which set of wall images to use.

The next 256 bytes are a 16x16 representation of the map tiles. For each byte:
01/02   West wall present. Bits select which image set to use for this wall.
04/08   South wall present. Bits select which image set to use for this wall.
10/20   East wall present. Bits select which image set to use for this wall.
40/80   North wall present. Bits select which image set to use for this wall.
